2. [A reduced test case.](https://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/)
	- Clearly demonstrate the bug or issue.
	- Include the bare minimum HTML, CSS, and JavaScript required to demonstrate the bug.
	- A link to your production site is **not** a reduced test case.

Duplicates and issues without a reduced test case may be closed without comment.
